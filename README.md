--- ERROR HANDLING STRATEGY ---
The Movie Hunter application has a MovieError Enum, which defines various types of errors that may occur, each associated with a specific error message. This enum aims to streamline error handling throughout the application by providing descriptive error cases that can be used in guard-let statements. When there is an error, the appropriate case from MovieError is thrown instead of using generic error handling.
